# License-Management
This class analyzes data from the FlexLM License Manager to create a live license dashboard using an open-source set of tools. Using Business Intelligence platforms (BI) and MySQL, we identify the demand and consumption of licenses per application, group of applications, and users per design team. The interactive dashboard will provide valuable statistics of the license usage per software, which help to predict the license consumption for future projects.

Learning Objective:
-Learn how to create a license dashboard with an open-source database
-Learn how to prepare the open-source database to receive data from FlexLM License Manager
-Learn how to track the license usage per user to identify consumption and demand
-Learn how to identify how many licenses a single person is using after opening multiple applications
